            <h2>How to Play</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>You play by spliting a deck of cards in two,
                 and you and your opponent each get half.<br>
                 <em>For now it's just a computer</em></li>
                <li>Draw one card off the top of your deck 
                 and the opponent does as well.</li>
                <li>Whoever has the highest card wins the hand.</li>
                <li>The winner takes both cards and puts 
                 them at the bottom of their deck.</li>
                <li>Once one player is completly out of cards, 
                 the game is over.</li>
