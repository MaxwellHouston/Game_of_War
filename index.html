            <h2>How to Play</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Play starts by spliting a deck of cards in two,
                 and you and your opponent each get half.</li>
                <li>Place one card off the top of your deck on the table 
                 and the opponent does this as well.</li>
                <li>In case of a tie, each player puts down two addition cards face down, and a third one face up.</li>
                <li>Repeat step 3 if necessary.</li> 
                <li>Whoever has the highest card wins the hand.</li>
                <li>The winner takes all cards on the table and puts 
                 them at the bottom of their deck.</li>
                <li>Once one player is completly out of cards, 
                 the game is over.</li>
            </ol>

                <p>This browser based game is based on the card game, war. It was made with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.</p>
                <p>I started this project to work along side the curriculum at Codecademy. I'm currently taking the full-stack engineering course and have been applying what I learn to this game.</p>
