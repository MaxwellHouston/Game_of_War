#Game of War

>“Victorious warriors win first and then go to war, 
>while defeated warriors go to war first and then seek to win”
>― Sun Tzu, The Art of War

This is my first coding project. It is a browser based version of the card game, War.

## How to play
1. You play by spliting a deck of cards in two, and you and your opponent each get half.*For now it's just a computer*
2. Draw one card off the top of your deck and the oppenent does as well.
3. Whoever has the highest card wins the hand.
4. The winner takes both cards and puts them at the bottom of the deck.
5. Once one player is completly out of cards, the game is over.

### *still a work in progress. once the game is playable I will update the README *
