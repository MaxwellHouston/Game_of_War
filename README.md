# Game of War

>“Victorious warriors win first and then go to war, 
>while defeated warriors go to war first and then seek to win”
>― Sun Tzu, The Art of War

## Introduction
This is my first coding project. It is a browser based version of the card game, War.

## Project Goals
I started this project to help grow my coding abilities alongside the curiculum on Codecademy.
Every time I learn a new skill and see how it could improve the project I update my work. 
Eventually I want this to be a fully functional browser based game that you can play against the computer or with a friend.

## Language
Currently the only code is javascript. Once I learn more I am looking to incorperate CSS and HTML to make a better overall project.

## How to play
1. You play by spliting a deck of cards in two, and you and your opponent each get half.*For now it's just a computer*
2. Draw one card off the top of your deck and the oppenent does as well.
3. Whoever has the highest card wins the hand.
4. The winner takes both cards and puts them at the bottom of the deck.
5. Once one player is completly out of cards, the game is over.

## Project status
Currently I've only worked through some of the initial javascript code. More to come in the near future.

### *still a work in progress. once the game is playable I will update the README*
